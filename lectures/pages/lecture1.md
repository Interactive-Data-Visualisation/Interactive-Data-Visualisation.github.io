# Lecture 1 - Visualisation, Data and Tasks

--- 

In this lecture we will first define what is Data Visualisation: a tool facilitating the cooperation between the human's interpretative mind and the machine's computational power when analysing vast amount of information.

We will also consider the motivations for visualising data, along with the reasons for considering interaction too.

On these premises, we will explore the two components that will enable us to effectively restrict our interactive visualisation design space (*how*):

 - *What* - the data that we want to consider
 - *Why* - the tasks that we, or our users, will be performing
