                    This course teaches the theoretical principles of visualising data and supporting dynamic 
                    analysis with interaction, partly inspired by the book
                    <i>Visualization Analysis & Design</i> by Tamara Munzner (2015). The books
                    <i>Visualize This</i> (2011) and <i>Data Points</i> (2013) by Nathan Yau are also good references.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also puts this theory in practice with <i><a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a></i>, 
                    by building interactive data visualisation dashboards from scratch. The documentation 
                    for <i>D3.js</i> can be found <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md">here</a>. 
                    There are several books, online tutorials and fora explaining and demonstrating D3 examples. 
                    Note, however, that this course uses version 7 of the library, so some resources may be outdated!
                    The <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> community also has plenty of examples to explore.
                </p>

                    The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">MDN Web Documentation</a> should
                    also be used for up-to-date HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript references.

                    The lectures comprise 9 Units covering the theoretical knowledge behind visualising datasets and
                    supporting interactivity.
                </p>
                <p">

            <div>
                <p">
                    The tutorials mostly serve as introduction to the practicals, covering technical aspects of D3.js 
                    (and web development) often in relation to the lecture material too.

            <div>
                <p">
                    The practicals consist of guided exercises applying the concepts seen in tutorials. They also include
                    self-study activities to go further.
                </p>
                <p">
                    Each practical builds on-top of the other, and should therefore be completed in order. The first practical
                    covers the development environment and serves as a introduction/revision to basic web development concepts.
